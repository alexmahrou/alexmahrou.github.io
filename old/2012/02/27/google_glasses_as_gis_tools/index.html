            <p>Nick Bilton, from the NY Times recently posted an article about a new product from Google called Google glasses.In his article, he talks about how these glasses will use augmented reality to play location-based games, display advertisements, connect with friends, etc. What I found missing from this conversation and subsequent conversations around the web, was the perspective on how geospatial developers would be able to exploit the power of this new medium through an api.Wouldn't it be great if this could be used as a field tool to help us "literally visualize" the assets in our geospatial datasets?Imagine a first responder, ambulance driver, police officer being able to know for sure that the address they pulled up at is indeed the right one? What kind of information or data about this property would be useful for this first responder? Given the fact that we already have these E911 datasets, we could take it a step further by integrating them with this tool.Imagine integrating this tool with a BIM, and arming a firefighter with the ability to navigate through an area with poor to no visibility-- safely.How about utility companies? Surely it would be nice if they could drive right up to an asset, visualize it in real-time, and update the asset database more easily.What I'm speaking about already exists. However the tools that accomplish these tasks are in the form of Toughbooks strapped to the inside of a vehicle, or a pda that can be a hindrance during a critical moment that you would need both of your hands. The underlying datasets that these existing tools pull from already exist-- they are curated by Geospatial professionals in our field. In addition, one would assume that these glasses would integrate with the Maps API, which happens to be the most popular Google api in the world right now-- for which many organizations have already confidently embraced.The tools to exploit these datasets might change form factors one day; and I believe these Google Glasses are a good tool to bridge the gap between augmented reality and GIS.Cheers,Alex Mahrou</p>
