            <p>TweetI had to post a quick round-up on my reactions to some big news in the industry this week.  Apple is not storing your every move if you have an iPhone or iPad.  Will Clarke over on his blog showed that it's probably mapping cell phone tower locations for use with aGPS.  I learned a few things from today's scaremongering:  You can score an interview on Where 2.0 with very little vetting and researchPeople find a table filled with lat/longs/ on a mobile device and privacy concerns go viral quite fast. This opens up a new project for crowd-sourcing the locations of cell phone towers.  Location based tech is everywhere, and the General Public still does not understand the technology behind the devices and services that we use everyday.Never let the truth get in the way of a juicy story!Google announced Google Earth Builder (fast-forward to minute 4:48).  A cloud platform for building maps.  They admitted that they will competitively price this new service with similar services offered by Esri.  Here's my take....  I think that competition in this space is good. It will force the legacy market dominator (Esri) to innovate to maintain. Google has a long way to go however. People have their criticisms of Esri, however they have a burgeoning Reseller, Business Partner, development, and distribution network that embraces the product. Google does not have this sort of organized channel on the Geospatial side. You are always greeted with an internal "contact sales" door, when trying to learn more about Google Enterprise Geospatial Offerings.In fact, many companies have built solutions that leverage cloud storage, and the Google Maps API interface. This play might serve to alienate those aforementioned shops and their solutions.Remember how you could buy the Nexus One direct from Google? Boy was that a success.This play is a long time coming however. Google needed a way to bridge the gap for its users between obtaining data, authoring a map, and sharing it in a sexy browser window without hiring a kml/python/php/mysql Gypsy to do so. There were hints in fusion tables, and "my maps" that the potential for something better to come along existed. Looking good with this new offering won't be too hard. Working on a way to integrate tools for geographic analysis into this new product is the biggest challenge and should be their ongoing focus.  Here is a link to a Directions Magazine article that outlines the new product.  </p>
