            <p>TweetJust last Monday, I published an article in Directions Magazine entitled "Whats' the deal with the Lightsquared/GPS clash?". Within an hour of publishing, I get an email from someone I don't know, and they tell me that I should have told a different story. How polite of them (see below).I thought it strange to receive an email from a stranger telling me what to do-- who did not provide any reference to the company that they worked for in their signature. Also, they just copied and pasted text from a Lightsquared press release into the email.I decided to research this person's contact information and learned that they work for a PR firm in the telecom industry located just outside of Washington D.C.(must be a coincidence, right?) This person also used to be a Vice President at a very prominent Wireless company which shall remain nameless. I told this person that they were free to share their opinion in the "comments" section of the article (which they never did).Here is my public response:Your communication to me insinuates that my article lacks a "balanced view". I am having a hard time coming to grips with how scientific proof of interference and the laws of physics fail to provide a "balanced view." Therefore, I'll point you, and anyone else reading my text to an upcoming webinar on May 26th hosted by the real industry experts at GPSWorld.Also, if my article paints a picture that this network's venture is lacking in credibility and organized business practice, then let me show you that people smarter than this "garage blogger" share the same opinion (GigaOm).The Bottom LineThings are coming out every day to further shed light on this topic. Just the day before yesterday, articles abounded on the Internet about how Lightsquared has now tap-danced  on their public FAQ-- changing the 2011 launch date to 2012. They claimed it was a "misunderstanding".In closing, proponents might tell you that Lightsquared has spent millions designing filters (to be applied to GPS receivers) that would negate all interference between the two technologies. This might be true. However as a GPS user, can you imagine the time, energy, and money it would take to retrofit every single legacy precision GPS unit out there with a filter so that this company can wholesale 4G LTE services for profit?Get involved at Saveourgps.orgWhat's the deal with the Lightsquared/GPS clash?Don't forget to register for the GPSWorld webinar tomorrow for a balanced view from industry experts."No one should approach the temple of science with the soul of a money changer."  ~Thomas BrowneCheers,Alex MahrouP.S. Leave comments, don't email me...</p>
